our rules:

  - tabs = 2 spaces
  - double quotes
  - give a name, in English, that represent what the variable is or the function does
    with _ as space
    : read_sensor instead of ReadSensor
  - No capitals
  - don't be scared to comment
  - Always give an explanation of what a function does
  - comments inside a function:
    single line before commands that belong together
    if a single line of code needs explaination -> just write comment next to it
  - Use of {}
    loop {
    do something;
    }
    
  an example is given in /docs/images/formatcomments
